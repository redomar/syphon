## Database Schema

The system uses the existing Prisma schema with the following main models:

- `User` - Connected to Clerk authentication
- `Category` - For income/expense categorization
- `IncomeSource` - For tracking income origins
- `Transaction` - For recording all financial movements

## API Security

All endpoints include:

- Authentication via Clerk
- User isolation (users can only access their own data)
- Input validation
- OpenTelemetry tracing for monitoring
- Proper error handling and status codes

## Type Safety

- Comprehensive TypeScript types in `src/lib/types.ts`
- Form validation utilities
- Currency formatting helpers
- Date formatting utilities

## Usage

1. **First Time Setup**: Click "Quick Setup" to create default categories and sources
2. **Add Categories**: Use "Add Category" to create custom income/expense categories
3. **Add Sources**: Use "Add Source" to create income source entities
4. **Record Income**: Use "Add Income" to record transactions with full categorization

## Next Steps

Consider implementing:

- Bulk transaction import
- Transaction editing/deletion
- Advanced filtering and search
- Budget integration
- Reporting and analytics
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- Transaction categories auto-suggestion based on description
